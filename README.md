##Clean up the Smartphones Dataset
By running My_Project.R, the raw data (smartphones datasets) is downloaded and unpacked and following operations are performed:

1.The training and the test sets are merged to create one data set.

2.Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted.

3.Descriptive activity names are used to name the activities in the data set

4.The data set is appropriately labelled with descriptive variable names.

5.From the data set in step 4, a second, independent tidy data set (tidy_dataset.csv) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is created.
